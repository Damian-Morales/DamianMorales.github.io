# Home Network Security Hardening Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **improving the security posture of a typical home network** by identifying vulnerabilities, hardening connected devices, and documenting best practices for secure configurations.

The goal is to **reduce attack surface**, **increase visibility**, and **develop a systematic process** for maintaining network security at home.

## Project Setup
1. **Create a new directory for documentation and screenshots**
   ```bash
   mkdir screenshots
   
## Step 1: Network Mapping

To begin the hardening process, I logged into my routerâ€™s local web interface (192.168.1.1) to document network topology and connected devices.

### Key Information Collected
- **Router Model & Firmware:** Helps verify that the device is up to date with the latest vendor patches.  
- **Wireless Settings:** Shows encryption mode (WPA2/WPA3) and SSID configuration.  
- **Connected Devices:** Lists all active endpoints on the LAN and Wi-Fi networks.  
- **DHCP Configuration:** Identifies internal IP range and lease time.
