<h1>Decrypt Data with Linux Commands</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this lab, I explored basic cryptographic techniques and practiced using Linux command line tools to uncover and decrypt hidden messages. I was introduced to concepts like encryption, decryption, and the Caesar cipherâ€”one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.</p>
<p>This exercise emphasized the importance of encryption in safeguarding data, especially in cybersecurity roles where understanding cryptographic controls is essential.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>I encountered a simulated situation where several files in my Linux home directory had been encrypted. My goal was to decrypt them using command-line techniques.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, I explored the contents of the directory to understand the file structure and content. <strong>Next</strong>, I located a hidden file and applied Caesar cipher decryption to reveal the contents. <strong>Finally</strong>, I decrypted the main encrypted data file to access the hidden message.</p>
