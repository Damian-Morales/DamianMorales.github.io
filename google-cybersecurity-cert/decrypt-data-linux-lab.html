  <h1>Decrypt Data with Linux Commands</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this lab, I explored basic cryptographic techniques and practiced using Linux command line tools to uncover and decrypt hidden messages. 
    I was introduced to concepts like encryption, decryption, and the Caesar cipherâ€”one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    This exercise emphasized the importance of encryption in safeguarding data, especially in cybersecurity roles where understanding cryptographic controls is essential.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    I encountered a simulated situation where several files in my Linux home directory had been encrypted. My goal was to decrypt them using command-line techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>First</strong>, I explored the contents of the directory to understand the file structure and content. 
    <strong>Next</strong>, I located a hidden file and applied Caesar cipher decryption to reveal the contents. 
    <strong>Finally</strong>, I decrypted the main encrypted data file to access the hidden message.
  </p>

    <strong>Note:</strong> The lab session began with me logged in as user <code>analyst</code> and working in the directory <code>/home/analyst</code>.
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This lab helped reinforce essential Linux command line skills for working with encrypted data. By completing this lab, I successfully:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Listed and explored hidden files</li>
    <li>Decrypted text using the Caesar cipher</li>
    <li>Decrypted a data file to access its hidden content</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These are foundational skills for understanding and applying encryption techniques as a cybersecurity analyst.
