  <h1>DNS & ICMP Incident Analysis Report</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This report examines DNS query failures and ICMP unreachable packets observed in network traffic. The analysis is based on data from a lab environment simulating unusual DNS behavior and network interruptions. 
    The full traffic log is available here:
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1enpRzrIao3J2Lp2tOI0hmu1Cu7D7CjLGhFAiTiR9J64/edit?gid=218501934#gid=218501934" target="_blank">
      DNS/ICMP Traffic Log
    </a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario Summary</h2>
  <p>
    DNS requests from internal hosts consistently failed to resolve a specific domain. In response, ICMP Destination Unreachable messages were generated, indicating that the DNS servers were unreachable. 
    The pattern suggested either misconfigured routing or a denial-of-service event affecting the availability of DNS services.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple DNS requests with no response</li>
    <li>ICMP Type 3 Code 1 (Destination Unreachable, Host Unreachable) repeatedly returned</li>
    <li>Downstream communication with critical infrastructure was disrupted</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wireshark for protocol filtering and analysis</li>
    <li>ICMP and DNS display filters</li>
    <li>Packet follow-up analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The ICMP error messages confirmed that internal systems could not reach the DNS service. This failure caused interruptions to name resolution and reflected availability issues.
    The ability to identify these patterns through packet analysis helps detect and respond to infrastructure disruptions early.
