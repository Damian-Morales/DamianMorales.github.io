    <h1>Debugging Python Code</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges faced by analysts is ensuring that automated processes run smoothly. 
      Debugging is an important practice that security analysts incorporate in their work to identify errors in code 
      and resolve them so that the code achieves the desired outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a series of tasks in this lab, you'll develop and apply your debugging skills in Python.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      In your work as a security analyst, you need to apply debugging strategies to ensure your code works properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this lab, you'll work with code that is similar to what you've written before, 
      but now it has some errors that need to be fixed. You'll need to read code cells, run them, identify the errors, 
      and adjust the code to resolve the errors.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>What are your key takeaways from this lab?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Debugging is an essential practice that analysts use to identify errors in code 
        and fix them to ensure that the code runs smoothly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Python executes code from top to bottom and stops once it encounters an error. 
        So if there are multiple errors in a code cell, the outputted error message will typically show the first error.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Python, common types of errors include syntax errors, logic errors, and exceptions.
        <ul>
          <li>Syntax errors often involve punctuation such as a missing <code>:</code> 
            at the end of a <code>with</code> statement header 
            and a missing <code>,</code> between elements in a list.
          </li>
          <li>Logic errors could involve incorrect indices when accessing elements from a list.</li>
          <li>Exceptions could involve misspelled variable names or incorrectly called string methods.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A key strategy for debugging is running code and examining if it produces the intended results. 
        If the output isn't correct, or if it displays an error message, 
        use this to identify which line(s) of the code could be causing the issue. 
        After fixing the code, it's important to run it again to ensure that everything works as expected.
      </li>
    </ul>
