  <h1>Python in Cybersecurity – My Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In course 7, I focused on building and applying Python skills for cybersecurity. I learned how to write scripts to automate security tasks, process and parse data, and debug my code to ensure it worked correctly. These skills help me develop repeatable processes and improve efficiency as an analyst.</p>

  <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Python</h2>
  <p>I reviewed Python fundamentals, including variables, data types, conditional logic, and loops. Understanding how these core elements work gave me a strong base for creating more advanced scripts in future modules.</p>

  <h2>Module 2: Writing Effective Python Code</h2>
  <p>In this module, I practiced creating clear and reusable code by working with functions and exploring modules. I also applied best practices to keep scripts easy to maintain and debug.</p>

  <h2>Module 3: Working with Strings and Lists</h2>
  <p>Here, I learned how to process strings and lists in Python to extract and manipulate data, which is vital when handling logs or alerts. I also practiced using regular expressions to identify patterns efficiently.</p>

  <h2>Module 4: Python in Practice</h2>
  <p>This final module put everything together with hands-on labs. I wrote scripts to automate file parsing, apply updates to allow lists, and debug code to ensure workflows ran smoothly. Practicing these real-world tasks strengthened my confidence in using Python for security automation.</p>
