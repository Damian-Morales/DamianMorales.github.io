  <h1>Play It Safe – Managing Security Risks (Course 2) – My Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Course 2, I expanded my grasp of risk management by mapping real-world threats to business functions, diving into security frameworks, and learning how SIEM tools and playbooks support consistent incident response.</p>

  <h2>Module 1: Security Domains</h2>
  <p>I explored the eight CISSP security domains and learned to classify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities within each domain. Understanding how domains interrelate helped me see where to focus controls and monitoring efforts.</p>

  <h2>Module 2: Security Frameworks and Controls</h2>
  <p>I examined the CIA triad and walked through the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, discovering how organizations apply preventive and detective controls. I also reviewed OWASP’s top risks and internal auditing practices to reinforce governance concepts.</p>

  <h2>Module 3: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools</h2>
  <p>I gained an overview of SIEM platforms and how entry-level analysts use dashboards to aggregate logs, detect anomalies, and investigate alerts. This hands-on look clarified the role of centralized logging in threat detection.</p>

  <h2>Module 4: Playbooks for Incident Response</h2>
  <p>I learned how playbooks document step-by-step actions for common incidents. By following example workflows and flowcharts, I practiced responding to phishing and malware alerts in a structured, repeatable way.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Course 2 reinforced the connection between frameworks, tools, and procedural playbooks. I feel confident identifying risks, selecting appropriate controls, and applying playbooks to guide effective, consistent incident responses.</p>
