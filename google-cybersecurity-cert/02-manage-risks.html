  <h1>Course 2: Play It Safe – Manage Security Risks</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This course focused on risk management, common security threats, frameworks, and the tools used by security analysts to respond to vulnerabilities. I learned about CISSP security domains, security frameworks, SIEM tools, and playbooks to guide incident response.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 1: Security Domains</h3>
  <p>
    I explored the eight CISSP security domains and how they relate to threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. The module also introduced the Risk Management Framework (RMF).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the CISSP security domains</li>
    <li>Define threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in business</li>
    <li>Identify high-priority threats for entry-level analysts</li>
    <li>Recognize how threats impact business operations</li>
    <li>Learn the steps of risk management</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 2: Security Frameworks and Controls</h3>
  <p>
    This module introduced the CIA triad and NIST frameworks, emphasizing how businesses apply controls to protect information. I also reviewed OWASP and internal audit practices.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Purpose of security frameworks and controls</li>
    <li>Describe the CIA triad</li>
    <li>Overview of NIST frameworks and principles</li>
    <li>Understand OWASP and internal security audits</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 3: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools</h3>
  <p>
    I learned about Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, including how entry-level analysts use them to monitor and respond to threats.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Common SIEM tools and their functions</li>
    <li>How SIEMs protect business operations</li>
    <li>Using SIEM dashboards as an entry-level analyst</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 4: Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents</h3>
  <p>
    This module covered the use of playbooks in cybersecurity to guide analysts during incident response. I learned how they’re structured and applied to real-world threats.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define the purpose and role of playbooks</li>
    <li>Apply playbooks in response to threats, risks, and vulnerabilities</li>
  </ul>
