  <h1>Course 2: Manage Security Risks</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>This course focused on understanding and managing cybersecurity risks in organizational settings. It emphasized the importance of risk management frameworks, business continuity, and security assessments in reducing vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h3>Module 1: Security Domains and Frameworks</h3>
  <p>This module explored the key areas covered by security frameworks such as NIST, ISO/IEC 27001, and CIS Controls. It helped me understand how to align security practices with business needs.</p>

  <h3>Module 2: Security Risk Management</h3>
  <p>This module introduced the risk management lifecycle—identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor. I practiced evaluating risk based on likelihood and impact and aligning controls with risk priorities.</p>

  <h3>Module 3: Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery</h3>
  <p>I learned how organizations prepare for unexpected events that could disrupt operations. The module covered recovery strategies, backup planning, and the importance of recovery time objectives (RTOs).</p>

  <h3>Module 4: Security Assessment and Testing</h3>
  <p>This module covered different types of assessments, including vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and audits. I learned how assessments help organizations identify weaknesses and measure the effectiveness of security controls.</p>
