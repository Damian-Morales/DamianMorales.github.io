  <h1>Threat Modeling with PASTA – My Work</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this activity, I performed a threat model of a new sneaker-buying app using the PASTA framework. I worked through all seven stages to identify business objectives, technical scope, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls. The result is a set of security requirements I can share with the development team.</p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>I’m part of the security team at a company building a mobile app for sneaker enthusiasts to buy and sell shoes. The app supports user sign-up, messaging between buyers and sellers, rating functionality, and payment processing. My goal was to use PASTA to uncover risks and recommend safeguards before launch.</p>

  <h2>Work Done</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>PASTA Stage</th>
        <th>My Response</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>I. Business Objectives</th>
        <td>
          I noted that the app must process secure transactions, enable real-time messaging, and comply with PCI-DSS regulations. I also highlighted the need for high availability and data privacy to maintain user trust.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>II. Technical Scope</th>
        <td>
          I reviewed that the app uses a REST API for frontend-backend communication, PKI/TLS for encryption, SHA-256 for data integrity, and SQL database storage. I prioritized securing the API first—because it exposes the most functionality—and enforcing TLS to protect data in transit.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>III. Decompose Application</th>
        <td>
          I examined the data-flow diagram showing “Search → Query DB → Return Listings.” I mapped out where user input enters the API, how credentials are validated, and where transaction records are stored.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>IV. Threat Analysis</th>
        <td>
          I identified two key threats: <strong>external attackers</strong> launching SQL injection via the search endpoint, and <strong>insider misuse</strong> of administrative APIs to alter listings.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>V. Vulnerability Analysis</th>
        <td>
          I found potential SQL injection in unsanitized queries and weak session tokens prone to hijacking. These flaws could let an attacker exfiltrate data or impersonate users.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>VI. Attack Modeling</th>
        <td>
          I built an attack tree with root “Compromise App,” branches for “Inject SQL,” “Hijack Session,” and “Exploit API Keys,” and leaves detailing input vectors and session cookie theft.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>VII. Controls & Mitigations</th>
        <td>
          I recommended using prepared statements/ORM to prevent injection, enforcing TLS with PKI, implementing MFA for administrative access, and performing regular code reviews and automated security testing.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By completing PASTA end-to-end, I captured the app’s security goals, mapped its architecture, listed threats and weaknesses, and proposed a layered defense strategy. These controls will help the development team build a more secure sneaker-marketplace app before it goes live.</p>
