  <h1>Course 3: Connect and Protect – Networks and Network Security</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this course, I explored network design, communication protocols, network threats, and how to secure systems against intrusion. I also learned about firewalls, hardening techniques, and strategies to protect both local and cloud-based infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 1: Network Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    I learned how different types of networks are structured and how data travels through them. This included the TCP/IP model, physical components of a network, and foundational architecture concepts.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Types of networks and network architecture</li>
    <li>TCP/IP communication framework</li>
    <li>How data moves through a network</li>
    <li>Physical network components</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 2: Network Operations</h3>
  <p>
    This module covered communication protocols, wireless access methods, and tools used to keep network operations secure and reliable. I explored the role of firewalls and security protocols.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Network and wireless protocols</li>
    <li>Firewalls and their functions</li>
    <li>Security tools that protect network operations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 3: Secure Against Network Intrusions</h3>
  <p>
    I studied various attack methods used to compromise networks and the tactics analysts use to detect, respond to, and investigate intrusions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Types of network attacks and breaches</li>
    <li>How to secure networks from intrusion</li>
    <li>Security investigation tools and tactics</li>
    <li>Basic network troubleshooting</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 4: Security Hardening</h3>
  <p>
    In this final module, I learned how to proactively defend systems through OS and network hardening. I also studied cloud security practices to protect modern infrastructure.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>OS, network, and cloud hardening techniques</li>
    <li>Preventive security strategies</li>
    <li>Cloud-based security controls</li>
  </ul>
