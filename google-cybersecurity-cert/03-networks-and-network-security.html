  <h1>Connect and Protect – Networks and Network Security (Course 3) – My Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Course 3, I explored how networks are designed, how data moves across them, and the strategies used to secure both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. I learned about core protocols, common threats, and the tools and techniques that keep communications safe.</p>

  <h2>Module 1: Network Architecture</h2>
  <p>I learned how different network types—LANs, WANs, and the internet backbone—are structured and how data flows through the TCP/IP model. Mapping physical components like switches and routers helped me understand how networks support services and where security controls fit.</p>

  <h2>Module 2: Network Operations</h2>
  <p>I practiced with essential network and wireless protocols and examined how firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and other tools maintain availability and integrity. This hands-on exploration showed me how operations teams keep traffic flowing securely and reliably.</p>

  <h2>Module 3: Secure Against Network Intrusions</h2>
  <p>I studied attack methods such as port scanning, packet sniffing, and denial-of-service, and learned how to detect and respond to them using monitoring tools. Understanding intrusion tactics sharpened my ability to investigate breaches and apply the right defensive measures.</p>

  <h2>Module 4: Security Hardening</h2>
  <p>In the final module, I focused on proactive defenses—hardening operating systems, configuring secure network architectures, and applying cloud security best practices. These techniques showed me how to reduce attack surfaces before adversaries strike.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Completing Course 3 gave me a solid grasp of how networks operate and how to defend them. I feel confident designing secure network segments, tuning monitoring tools, and hardening systems to withstand real-world attacks.</p>
