    <h1>Filtering Information with GREP Lab</h1>

    <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab, I practiced using the <code>grep</code> command and piping to search for specific content in files.
        This builds on what I’ve already learned about navigating the Linux file system and helps me focus on filtering and retrieving useful information from large data sets.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a future security analyst, it's crucial that I know how to find exactly what I need—quickly and efficiently. 
        Filtering commands like <code>grep</code> are powerful tools in doing that.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>
        In this scenario, I needed to analyze server logs and user files to find specific pieces of information.
        Here's what I did:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Went to the <code>logs</code> directory and used <code>grep</code> to return error messages in the <code>server_logs.txt</code> file.</li>
        <li>Moved into the <code>users</code> directory and searched for files that included a specific string in their names.</li>
        <li>Performed additional searches within the user files to extract needed information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This activity helped me gain experience searching both by file name and by content inside the files.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        I now have practical experience with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using <code>grep</code> to search for specific content within files</li>
        <li>Using piping to filter and locate information more efficiently</li>
        <li>Finding files that contain certain strings or patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is a fundamental Linux skill that will save time and increase efficiency when working with logs or analyzing incidents.
