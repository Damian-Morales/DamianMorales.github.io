    <h1>Security Organization Worksheet</h1>

    <h2>My Security Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I am most interested in areas like cloud infrastructure security, responding to incidents, protecting sensitive data, and promoting security awareness throughout organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>Organizations I Researched</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)</strong> – Focuses on developing best practices and education to secure cloud computing environments.</li>
      <li><strong>CISO Executive Network</strong> – Brings together senior-level security and risk leaders to share knowledge and strategies for information protection and privacy.</li>
      <li><strong>National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA)</strong> – Advocates for digital safety and empowers individuals and organizations to stay secure against cyber threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Alignment with My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Of these organizations, the Cloud Security Alliance most closely aligns with my current interests in strengthening cloud security practices. Its mission to advance cloud protection through guidelines and collaboration is valuable to my professional development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CISO Executive Network seems more appropriate for senior security executives, which is beyond my current role. The National Cyber Security Alliance is great for general awareness but less specialized in my target area of cloud security.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      I plan to explore membership opportunities or resources with the Cloud Security Alliance so I can stay connected to the latest research, best practices, and community discussions about securing cloud environments.
