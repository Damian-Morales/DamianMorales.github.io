  <h1>Validate File Integrity with Hashes</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    As a security analyst, you'll need to implement security controls to protect organizations against a variety of threats. This lab focused on hashing, an important method for verifying file integrity.
  </p>
  <p>
    A hash is a unique string generated by an algorithm that reflects the contents of a file. If the file changes, even slightly, its hash will change. This makes hashing a reliable method for detecting tampering or unauthorized changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lab, I computed hashes for two files and used Linux commands to compare them. This helped simulate how integrity validation can prevent the spread of malicious or corrupted data.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    I was tasked with determining whether two files were identical or different by generating and comparing their hashes using command-line tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>First</strong>, I examined the content of the two files. <strong>Next</strong>, I generated hash values for both files using a hashing utility. <strong>Finally</strong>, I manually compared the hash outputs to determine file similarity.
  </p>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The lab began with me logged in as user <code>analyst</code>, and the home directory set to <code>/home/analyst</code>.
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This lab introduced core Linux tools for validating file integrity. I learned how to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate hashes with <code>sha256sum</code></li>
    <li>Display contents with the <code>cat</code> command</li>
    <li>Compare files using the <code>cmp</code> command</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These techniques are useful for confirming that data has not been modified or corrupted and play an important role in verifying software and security logs.
