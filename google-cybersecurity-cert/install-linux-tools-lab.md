# Install, Uninstall, and Reinstall Linux Tools Lab Report

## Lab Overview

In this lab, I practiced using the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and `sudo` to install, uninstall, and manage applications on a Linux Bash shell. The lab scenario required me to work with two network security tools: **Suricata** and **tcpdump**, both commonly used for capturing and analyzing network traffic.

## Scenario Summary

As a security analyst, my role was to ensure that both Suricata and tcpdump were installed and functioning properly in a Linux environment. The key tasks included:

- Confirming that APT was installed
- Installing and confirming Suricata
- Uninstalling Suricata and verifying removal
- Installing tcpdump and checking installed packages
- Reinstalling Suricata and confirming both tools were present

This lab simulated a realistic troubleshooting scenario where managing and verifying system packages is crucial for cybersecurity operations.

## Tools Used

- **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**: Used for installing, updating, and removing packages on Debian-based systems.
- **sudo**: Allows privileged commands to be executed securely.
- **Suricata**: A powerful network threat detection engine.
- **tcpdump**: A command-line packet analyzer.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Navigating and operating within a Linux Bash shell
- Using APT to install and remove applications
- Listing installed packages with `apt list --installed`
- Troubleshooting software availability and verifying installation success

## Reflection

This lab helped reinforce my knowledge of Linux administration—specifically package management—an essential task in any security role. By gaining hands-on experience with security tools like Suricata and tcpdump, I became more confident in preparing a secure environment for network monitoring and threat analysis.

## Conclusion

Successfully completing this lab demonstrated my ability to:

- Install and configure key network security applications
- Troubleshoot application states and dependencies
- Utilize APT to manage tools efficiently and securely

These are foundational skills for any aspiring cybersecurity analyst managing Linux-based systems.
