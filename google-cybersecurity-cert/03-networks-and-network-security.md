  <h1>Course 3: Connect and Protect – Networks and Network Security</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This course introduced the fundamentals of computer networking and the technologies and practices that protect network infrastructure. Topics included the OSI model, TCP/IP, IP addressing, network hardening, and layered defense strategies.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 1: Network Foundations</h3>
  <p>
    I learned how data travels across the internet, how IP addresses and ports function, and the purpose of routers, switches, and firewalls. The OSI and TCP/IP models were used to break down how data moves through a network.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 2: Network Hardening</h3>
  <p>
    This module explained how to secure network infrastructure using methods such as disabling unused services, securing network devices, implementing VLANs, and configuring firewalls and access control lists (ACLs).
  </p>

  <h3>Module 3: Network Monitoring and Traffic Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    I practiced using tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, identifying anomalies and investigating potential threats using protocol filters and flow patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 4: Layered Defense</h3>
  <p>
    This module reinforced the concept of defense-in-depth by combining physical, technical, and administrative controls. I learned how each layer contributes to overall protection from external and internal threats.
