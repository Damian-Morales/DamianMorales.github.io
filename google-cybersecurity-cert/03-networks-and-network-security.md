# Course 3: Networks and Network Security

This course provided a comprehensive understanding of how networks function, the types of threats they face, and the security protocols and hardening strategies used to protect them. Through four modules, I explored essential networking concepts, tools, and real-world scenarios relevant to the cybersecurity field.

## Key Learning Objectives by Module

### Module 1: Network Fundamentals

- Defined types of networks (LAN, WAN, PAN, etc.)
- Described physical network components (routers, switches, cables)
- Understood the role of the TCP/IP model in network communication
- Explained how data is transmitted over networks

### Module 2: Protocols and Security Tools

- Recognized common network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS)
- Described how protocols transmit/access data over networks
- Defined firewalls and their role in protecting traffic
- Identified tools and best practices for securing communication

### Module 3: Network Attacks and Intrusion Tactics

- Investigated security breaches and intrusion methods (DoS/DDoS, spoofing)
- Described different types of network attacks and how they operate
- Explained methods to secure a network against intrusions
- Used troubleshooting tools to assess and respond to network issues

### Module 4: Network Hardening and Defense

- Described OS, network, and cloud security hardening techniques
- Explored ways to reduce network vulnerabilities
- Learned how to secure cloud infrastructure and services
- Understood the value of preventive controls in long-term security

## Hands-On Activities

To reinforce the concepts covered in this course, I completed several hands-on incident report analyses based on real-world cybersecurity threats involving network protocols, traffic patterns, and layered defenses:

- [Analyze TCP SYN Attack & HTTP Interruption](dns-http-analysis.md)  
- [Malware Redirection Incident Report](malware-redirection-report.md)  
- [DNS icmp analysis](dns-icmp-analysis.md)
- [DDoS Incident Report with NIST CSF Analysis](ddos-csf-analysis.md)

These activities deepened my understanding of how to analyze suspicious traffic, identify common network-layer attacks, and apply cybersecurity frameworks such as the NIST CSF. They also enhanced my skills in incident documentation, protocol inspection, and strategic mitigation planning.
