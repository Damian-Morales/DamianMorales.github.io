  <h1>Incident Handler’s Journal – My Entry</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this exercise, I documented a ransomware attack against a small healthcare clinic using the incident handler’s journal template. I captured the key facts, logged the five W’s, and noted next steps to guide our response and recovery.</p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>On a Tuesday at 9:00 AM, staff at a primary-care clinic found their patient records encrypted by ransomware delivered via a phishing email. A demand note requested payment in exchange for a decryption key. My job was to record the full incident in the journal for later analysis and action.</p>

  <h2>My Journal Entry</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>My Details</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Date &amp; Entry #</th>
        <td>I made this entry on June 8, 2025 and labeled it as Entry #1.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Description</th>
        <td>I summarized the ransomware incident: patient files were encrypted and operations halted until the ransom demand was displayed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Tool(s) used</th>
        <td>I used the Google Docs journal template and reviewed the security console logs for timestamps and user alerts.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>The 5 W’s</th>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Who:</strong> An organized hacker group targeting healthcare</li>
            <li><strong>What:</strong> Ransomware encrypting critical clinical data</li>
            <li><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday at 9:00 AM</li>
            <li><strong>Where:</strong> Clinic’s internal file servers</li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> To extort payment by disrupting care delivery</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Additional notes</th>
        <td>I noted that emergency systems were offline and first responders were alerted. Next, I plan to coordinate decryption trials and notify compliance officers.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By structuring my observations in this journal entry, I ensured all critical details were captured for the incident response team. This record will guide our remediation steps and support post-incident review.</p>
