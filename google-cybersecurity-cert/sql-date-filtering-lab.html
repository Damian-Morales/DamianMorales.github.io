  <h1>SQL Date Filtering Lab</h1>

  <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
  <p>
    As a security analyst, youâ€™ll often need to query numbers and dates.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, you may need to filter patch dates to find machines that need an update.
    Or you might filter login attempts made during a certain time to investigate a security incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    Common operators for working with numeric or date and time data will help you accurately filter data.
    These are some of the operators you'll use:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>= (equal)</li>
    <li>&gt; (greater than)</li>
    <li>&lt; (less than)</li>
    <li>&lt;&gt; (not equal to)</li>
    <li>&gt;= (greater than or equal to)</li>
    <li>&lt;= (less than or equal to)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In this lab activity, I applied these operators to accurately filter for specific numbers and dates!
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    In this scenario, I investigated a recent security incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    I needed to gather information about login attempts for certain dates and times to help resolve the incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's how I approached the task:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>First</strong>, I retrieved login events made after a certain date.</li>
    <li><strong>Second</strong>, I narrowed the focus of the search to filter logins in a date range.</li>
    <li><strong>Third</strong>, I investigated logins that were made at certain times.</li>
    <li><strong>Finally</strong>, I filtered login attempts based on their event IDs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    I now have practical experience in using SQL to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply the <code>WHERE</code> keyword,</li>
    <li>Use the <code>BETWEEN</code> and <code>AND</code> operators, and</li>
    <li>Work with numeric or date and time data types using operators like <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'm now ready to filter for numbers and dates to extract all sorts of useful data!
