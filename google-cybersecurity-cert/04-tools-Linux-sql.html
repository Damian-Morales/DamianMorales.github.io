  <h1>Tools of the Trade – Linux &amp; SQL (Course 4) – My Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Course 4, I dove into the command line and database queries to build practical skills for incident investigations. I learned how to navigate and secure Linux systems, and how to use SQL to search, filter, and analyze data stored in relational databases.</p>

  <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Operating Systems</h2>
  <p>I explored the fundamentals of operating systems—how they manage hardware, run applications, and provide interfaces. This module helped me understand the key functions that underpin every security tool I’ll use.</p>

  <h2>Module 2: The Linux Operating System</h2>
  <p>I discovered why Linux is so prevalent in cybersecurity, reviewed its architecture and distributions, and familiarized myself with the shell as a powerful text-based interface for system administration.</p>

  <h2>Module 3: Linux Commands in the Bash Shell</h2>
  <p>Through hands-on practice, I mastered Bash commands to navigate directories, manage files and permissions, and perform administrative tasks with <code>sudo</code>. These skills are essential for securing and investigating Linux hosts.</p>

  <h2>Module 4: Databases and SQL</h2>
  <p>I learned to interact with relational databases using SQL—selecting, filtering, and joining tables to uncover patterns in data. Writing queries to extract relevant security events will help me support forensic and investigative tasks.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Completing this course equipped me with command-line proficiency and database query skills. I feel confident using Linux and SQL as core tools in my cybersecurity toolkit.</p>
