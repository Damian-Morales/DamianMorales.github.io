    <h1>Data Leak Privacy Review</h1>
    
    <h2>Course:</h2>
    <p>Google Cybersecurity Certificate - Course 5</p>

    <h2>Lab Type:</h2>
    <p>Data Privacy Review Activity</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this lab, I reviewed a data privacy risk event to determine whether the company followed proper access control practices. The goal was to evaluate how well information privacy is managed and to propose control improvements, focusing on implementing the <strong>principle of least privilege</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      A data exposure occurred at an educational tech company when an employee unintentionally shared confidential documents with an external contact. The files were part of a folder meant for internal marketing use, but access had not been properly restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role was to assess the cause, review current privacy policies and controls, and suggest improvements to prevent future incidents.

          <td><strong>Issue(s)</strong></td>
          <td><em>A shared folder intended for internal use was exposed to external users due to overly broad access permissions. The lack of oversight led to the unintentional release of sensitive materials.</em></td>

          <td>
            NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 recommends applying least privilege by assigning users only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. It also advises routine audits to ensure compliance and proper data protection.

          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>Enforce stricter access permissions based on role and task necessity.</li>
              <li>Implement recurring access reviews to remove outdated or excessive permissions.</li>

          <td><strong>Justification</strong></td>
          <td>
            Limiting access and performing regular audits helps minimize the risk of unauthorized data exposure. These practices reduce the chances of internal oversharing and help safeguard sensitive company information.
