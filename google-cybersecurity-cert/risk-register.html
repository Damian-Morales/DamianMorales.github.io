  <h1>Risk Register</h1>

  <h2>Operational Environment</h2>
  <p>
    The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank’s data—100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank’s services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <div class="note">
    Doing business with other companies might increase the risks to data since it presents other avenues for the information to be compromised. The risk of theft is important but might not be a priority because the bank is in an area with low crime rates.
