  <h1>Course 5 Summary – My Learning</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Course 5, I deepened my incident response skills by working through packet analysis, IDS rules, threat hunting in SIEMs, and playbook-driven investigations. Each module built on the last to give me hands-on practice with tools like Suricata, Splunk, tcpdump, Wireshark, VirusTotal, and Chronicle.</p>

  <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Detection and Incident Response</h2>
  <p>I learned the incident lifecycle—from detection through containment, eradication, and recovery—and the roles of a response team. I also explored the documentation and tooling that support each stage, setting a strong foundation for the rest of the course.</p>

  <h2>Module 2: Network Monitoring and Analysis</h2>
  <p>I practiced packet sniffing with both command-line and graphical tools. Using tcpdump and Wireshark, I captured live traffic, applied filters, and interpreted protocol data to spot anomalies and understand network communications.</p>

  <h2>Module 3: Incident Investigation and Response</h2>
  <p>I used VirusTotal to investigate a malicious hash, mapped indicators of compromise to the Pyramid of Pain, and followed a phishing playbook to triage and escalate alerts. This taught me how to combine evidence, playbook procedures, and clear documentation in a real-world SOC scenario.</p>

  <h2>Module 4: Network Traffic and Logs with IDS and SIEM Tools</h2>
  <p>I crafted custom Suricata signatures, triggered alerts on pcap data, and examined both fast.log and eve.json outputs. Then I ingested logs into Splunk Cloud and Chronicle, performed SPL and DQL searches, and located failed SSH attempts. This module reinforced how IDS and SIEM platforms work together in threat detection.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Completing Course 5 gave me a comprehensive, tool-driven workflow—from spotting malicious packets to documenting incidents and hunting threats in SIEMs. I feel confident applying these techniques in a SOC and adding this portfolio of skills to my professional profile.</p>
