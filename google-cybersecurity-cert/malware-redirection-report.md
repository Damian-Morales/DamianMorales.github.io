# Security Incident Report  
**Incident Title:** Malware Redirection via Brute Force Admin Compromise  
---

## Section 1: Identify the Network Protocol Involved in the Incident

During the investigation of the reported security issue on `yummyrecipesforme.com`, two network protocols were identified through the tcpdump log:

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Used to resolve domain names (e.g., `yummyrecipesforme.com`, `greatrecipesforme.com`) to IP addresses.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used to communicate with the web server, retrieve pages, and download files.

These protocols, operating at the application layer of the TCP/IP model, were leveraged to deliver malicious content and redirect users.

## Section 2: Document the Incident

### Summary of the Event
A former employee performed a brute force attack to gain admin access to the web host of `yummyrecipesforme.com`. By guessing the default password, they gained entry and modified the website’s source code.

The attacker embedded JavaScript that triggered a file download prompt upon visiting the site. When users downloaded and execute the file, their browsers were redirected to `greatrecipesforme.com`, a spoofed malicious website.

### Observed Behavior
1. The browser issued a DNS request for `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
2. The DNS server returned the IP address.
3. The browser sent an HTTP request and received the page.
4. A prompt appeared asking users to download a file.
5. After execution, the browser issued a DNS request for `greatrecipesforme.com`.
6. The DNS server responded with its IP.
7. The browser completed an HTTP request to the fake site.

### Impact
- Website visitors were exposed to malware.
- The company’s reputation and trust were compromised.
- The website’s admin access was locked out.

## Section 3: Recommend One Remediation for Brute Force Attacks

### Recommendation: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Implementing 2FA on all administrative logins ensures that even if passwords are compromised, unauthorized users cannot access sensitive accounts without a second verification step. This reduces the likelihood of future brute force attacks and enhances the organization’s security posture.
