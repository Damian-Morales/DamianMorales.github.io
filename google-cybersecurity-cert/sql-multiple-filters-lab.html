  <h1>Filtering with Multiple SQL Conditions Lab</h1>

  <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
  <p>As a security analyst in training, I’ve learned how important it is to analyze data from a database to uncover specific, security-relevant details. Often, the information I need depends on more than one condition.</p>
  <p>In this lab, I practiced using SQL filters to retrieve information that matched multiple conditions. I also learned how to filter out results that didn’t meet a particular condition.</p>
  <p>Specifically, I used the <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code> operators to construct complex SQL queries and fine-tune my search for data.</p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>During this lab, I was tasked with retrieving detailed information about employees, their machines, and departmental affiliations from the organization’s database. This information was critical for identifying potential security issues and planning updates.</p>

  <p>Here’s what I accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>First</strong>, I filtered and retrieved all failed login attempts that occurred after normal business hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Second</strong>, I pulled all login attempts that happened on specific dates.</li>
    <li><strong>Third</strong>, I identified logins that didn’t originate from Mexico.</li>
    <li><strong>Fourth</strong>, I located information about employees working in the Marketing department.</li>
    <li><strong>Fifth</strong>, I retrieved data on employees from either the Finance or Sales departments.</li>
    <li><strong>Finally</strong>, I filtered out employees not part of the Information Technology department.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This lab gave me hands-on experience writing SQL queries that handle complex filtering conditions. Specifically, I learned how to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Retrieve data that matched multiple filters simultaneously,</li>
    <li>Use <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code> to build logic into my queries, and</li>
    <li>Pull only the data most relevant to a given security scenario.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These skills will be essential as I continue working with SQL to support cybersecurity investigations and reporting.</p>
