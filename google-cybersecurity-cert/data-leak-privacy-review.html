  <h1>Data Leak Privacy Lab</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this lab activity, I evaluated a real-world data leak scenario and applied privacy principles to determine how to better protect organizational information. I focused on identifying access control weaknesses and improving safeguards in line with cybersecurity standards.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    An employee at an educational technology company unintentionally shared confidential documents with an external business partner. The files were stored in a shared folder with unrestricted access, violating least privilege principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    My task was to review the incident and recommend access control improvements using NIST guidance as a reference.
  </p>

  <h2>Investigation Summary</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Control</th>
      <td>Least privilege</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Issue(s)</th>
      <td>Access permissions were too broad, allowing external sharing of internal marketing documents without proper oversight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Review</th>
      <td>NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 recommends granting access based on roles and reviewing permissions periodically to ensure compliance with least privilege.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Recommendation(s)</th>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit access to sensitive materials by default.</li>
          <li>Conduct regular audits of file sharing permissions.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Justification</th>
      <td>Implementing stricter access controls and audits helps reduce accidental exposure of confidential data.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This exercise strengthened my understanding of how access control failures can lead to privacy risks. By applying the least privilege model and NIST recommendations, I was able to develop practical steps to improve information security.
