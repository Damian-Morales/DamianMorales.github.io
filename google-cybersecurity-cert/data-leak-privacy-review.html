  <h1>Data Leak Privacy Review</h1>

  <h2>Activity Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this lab activity, I evaluated a real-world data leak scenario and applied privacy principles to determine how to better protect organizational information. I focused on identifying access control weaknesses and improving safeguards in line with cybersecurity standards.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    An employee at an educational technology company unintentionally shared confidential documents with an external business partner. The files were stored in a shared folder with unrestricted access, violating least privilege principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    My task was to review the incident and recommend access control improvements using NIST guidance as a reference.
  </p>

  <h2>Investigation Summary</h2>
  <p><strong>Control Focus:</strong> Least Privilege</p>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Files in a marketing folder were too broadly shared, enabling unauthorized access by external parties.</p>
  <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Based on NIST SP 800-53: AC-6, access should be granted only as needed and reviewed periodically to limit unnecessary exposure.</p>
  <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restrict default file access and grant permissions based on user role.</li>
    <li>Schedule regular audits to identify and remove excessive permissions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Justification:</strong> These actions reduce accidental exposure by minimizing over-privileged access and ensuring ongoing oversight of sensitive data.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This exercise strengthened my understanding of how access control failures can lead to privacy risks. By applying the least privilege model and NIST recommendations, I was able to develop practical steps to improve information security.
