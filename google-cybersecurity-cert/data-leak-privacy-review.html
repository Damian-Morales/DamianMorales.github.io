  <h1>Data Leak Privacy Review</h1>

  <h2>Course:</h2>
  <p>Google Cybersecurity Certificate - Course 5</p>

  <h2>Lab Type:</h2>
  <p>Data Privacy Review Activity</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this activity, I reviewed the results of a data risk assessment to determine whether effective data handling processes are being implemented to protect 
    <strong>information privacy</strong>. The assessment focuses on minimizing exposure through the proper implementation of access controls like the 
    <strong>principle of least privilege</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>
    A data leak incident was reported at an educational technology company. An employee accidentally shared sensitive business documents with an external business partner. 
    The incident occurred because access to internal folders was too broadly granted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was asked to evaluate the event, review existing controls (based on NIST SP 800-53: AC-6), and provide improvement recommendations.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Privacy Assessment</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Control</th>
      <td>Least privilege</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Issue(s)</th>
      <td>
        File permissions were too lenient. A marketing folder meant for internal use was shared externally without adequate oversight, leading to the exposure of confidential content.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Review</th>
      <td>
        NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 outlines how least privilege should be implemented to safeguard data access. It emphasizes assigning users only the minimum permissions necessary for their roles, and recommends periodic reviews to strengthen compliance.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Recommendation(s)</th>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Limit access to sensitive files by default and grant access only as needed.</li>
          <li>Conduct regular audits of permission settings to ensure proper access is maintained.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Justification</th>
      <td>
        Tightening access controls reduces the chance of accidental leaks. Periodic audits ensure that outdated or excessive permissions are identified and removed. These steps significantly lower the risk of unauthorized data sharing.
      </td>
