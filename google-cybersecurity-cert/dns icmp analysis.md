##  Analysis and Solution

**Initial Report:**  
Users reported an inability to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com, experiencing DNS resolution errors.

**Investigation Findings:**  
- The DNS server at 203.0.113.2 was not responding to queries on port 53.  
- ICMP responses confirmed that the port was unreachable, suggesting the DNS service was down or blocked.

**Root Cause:**  
The DNS server's port 53 was not accepting connections due to:  
- The DNS service was not running.  
- Firewall settings were blocking UDP traffic on port 53.  
- Network misconfiguration or hardware failure.

**Recommended Actions:**
2. **Check Firewall Settings:** Confirm that port 53 is open for UDP traffic.  
3. **Restart DNS Service:** If the service is down, restart it to restore functionality.  
4. **Monitor Server Health:** Check for any hardware or network issues affecting the server.
