  <h1>Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This course introduced the foundational concepts of cybersecurity, including core skills, career paths, types of threats, risk management, and the tools used by entry-level analysts. I explored the importance of cybersecurity in modern organizations and the evolving role of a security analyst.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 1: Welcome to the Exciting World of Cybersecurity</h3>
  <p>
    I was introduced to the certificate program, its structure, and the field of cybersecurity. The module defined the role of a security analyst and emphasized key skills needed to succeed in this career.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How this program prepares learners for a security career</li>
    <li>Definition of security and analyst job roles</li>
    <li>Core skills and responsibilities of an entry-level analyst</li>
    <li>How analysts protect networks and data</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 2: The Evolution of Cybersecurity</h3>
  <p>
    This module covered the development of cybersecurity in response to growing digital threats. I learned how past and present attacks shaped the field and gained an introduction to the eight CISSP security domains.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Common types of attacks (past and present)</li>
    <li>Impact of security breaches on businesses</li>
    <li>How attacks shaped modern cybersecurity practices</li>
    <li>Overview of the eight CISSP security domains</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 3: Protect Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</h3>
  <p>
    I explored the CIA triad, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and how organizations use these models to define risk management strategies. The module also introduced cybersecurity ethics.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security frameworks and controls</li>
    <li>CIA triad and NIST CSF</li>
    <li>Using frameworks to reduce threats and vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Ethical responsibilities in cybersecurity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 4: Cybersecurity Tools and Programming Languages</h3>
  <p>
    I was introduced to the tools and languages security analysts use to detect, analyze, and respond to threats. This included SIEM tools, protocol analyzers, and programming with Python and SQL.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Common tools used by security analysts</li>
    <li>Purpose and function of those tools</li>
    <li>Basic use of programming languages like SQL and Python</li>
    <li>How analysts use tools/languages to reduce risk</li>
  </ul>
