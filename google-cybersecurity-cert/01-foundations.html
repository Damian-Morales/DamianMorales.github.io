  <h1>Foundations of Cybersecurity – My Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In Course 1, I built a solid base in cybersecurity: understanding the analyst’s role, exploring landmark attacks, and learning the frameworks and principles that guide every security decision. This foundation prepared me for the hands-on labs to come.</p>

  <h2>Module 1: Welcome to the Exciting World of Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>I discovered what it means to be a security analyst—daily responsibilities, key soft skills, and how SOC teams collaborate. Learning the program’s structure gave me a roadmap for advancing my career in this dynamic field.</p>

  <h2>Module 2: The Evolution of Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>By tracing major incidents—from early viruses to modern ransomware—I saw how each wave of threats forced defenders to innovate. This historical perspective helped me appreciate why we rely on defenses like network segmentation and encryption today.</p>

  <h2>Module 3: Protect Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</h2>
  <p>I delved into the CIA triad and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, mapping controls to organizational risk. Discussing ethics underscored the importance of responsible decision-making when protecting sensitive data.</p>

  <h2>Module 4: Cybersecurity Tools and Programming Languages</h2>
  <p>This module introduced core tools—SIEMs, IDS/IPS, packet analyzers—and gave me a taste of scripting with Python and querying with SQL. I now understand how these technologies work together to detect, analyze, and respond to threats.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Completing this foundational course solidified my understanding of why cybersecurity matters and how it’s organized. I’m confident in my grasp of key concepts and eager to apply them in the technical labs ahead.</p>
