#  Course 2: Manage Security Risks

##  Overview

This course taught me how to identify and manage risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in a cybersecurity context using industry-recognized frameworks like the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and the CISSP's eight security domains. I also explored the purpose of security audits, SIEM tools, and the importance of playbooks in security operations.

- Recognized and explained the focus of CISSP’s eight security domains.
- Defined primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations.
- Described the types of risks most relevant to entry-level analysts.
- Identified the steps in the risk management process (per NIST RMF).

###  Module 2: Security Frameworks and Audits
- Explained the purpose of security frameworks and the CIA triad.
- Introduced OWASP and its importance in web application security.
- Learned about the NIST CSF and internal security audit components.
- Identified security principles and how frameworks protect business operations.

###  Module 3: SIEM Tools for Risk Monitoring
- Identified and defined commonly used SIEM tools.
- Explained how SIEM dashboards support real-time event management.
- Understood how entry-level analysts interpret data using these tools.

###  Module 4: Playbooks for Incident Response
- Defined the purpose of cybersecurity playbooks.
- Practiced using playbooks to respond to threats and vulnerabilities.

##  Reflection

This course gave me a practical understanding of assessing and managing cyber risks, especially using structured frameworks like the NIST RMF and CISSP domains. I now feel more prepared to interpret audit results, respond to real-world threats with tools like SIEM, and develop playbooks to support incident response workflows.
