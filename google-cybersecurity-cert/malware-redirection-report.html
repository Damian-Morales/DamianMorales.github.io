  <h1>Malware Redirection Incident Report</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This incident report documents the identification and analysis of a potential malware redirection attack observed through a tcpdump log. The objective was to determine whether a user was redirected to a malicious IP address and evaluate the indicators of compromise. Here is the log: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDAQTLSK5CyPLPHeLI0s75kNE-kA2kG0NFJoZlz0xCc/template/preview?resourcekey=0-vDSHnW4qKxOOQtsZeGRUeQ.
  </p>

  <h2>Scenario Summary</h2>
  <p>
    During a forensic review of captured network traffic, a suspicious TCP session involving HTTP communication was examined. The session began with a GET request to a seemingly benign domain but was redirected to an IP address linked with known malicious activity.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Indicators</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>HTTP 302 redirect response to a raw IP address</li>
    <li>Unencrypted HTTP traffic revealing redirection</li>
    <li>Source IP matched known threat intelligence for malware hosting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wireshark for traffic capture</li>
    <li>TCP stream follows to trace session flow</li>
    <li>IP/domain threat reputation lookup</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This lab emphasized the importance of monitoring unencrypted HTTP sessions and inspecting redirect responses. The redirection to a known malicious IP address confirmed the likelihood of malware distribution tactics. This analysis highlights the value of packet-level review in proactive incident detection.
