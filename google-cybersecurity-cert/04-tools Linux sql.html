  <h1>Course 4: Tools of the Trade – Linux and SQL</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This course introduced the tools used to manage operating systems and databases. I explored how cybersecurity professionals use Linux, the command line, and SQL to investigate security incidents and maintain system integrity.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 1: Introduction to Operating Systems</h3>
  <p>
    I learned about the purpose of operating systems and how they manage hardware, applications, and user interaction. I explored both graphical and command-line interfaces.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Main functions of an operating system</li>
    <li>Common OS types and their use</li>
    <li>OS interaction with hardware and apps</li>
    <li>GUI vs. command-line interfaces</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 2: The Linux Operating System</h3>
  <p>
    This module introduced me to Linux architecture and its importance in cybersecurity. I reviewed Linux distributions and learned about the shell interface.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linux's role in security</li>
    <li>Linux system architecture</li>
    <li>Unique features of Linux distributions</li>
    <li>The shell as a text-based interface</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 3: Linux Commands in the Bash Shell</h3>
  <p>
    I practiced using Bash commands to navigate, manage, and secure Linux systems. This included managing file permissions and running administrative commands with <code>sudo</code>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>File system navigation with Bash</li>
    <li>Managing files and permissions</li>
    <li>Authentication and authorization</li>
    <li>Using <code>sudo</code> for root access</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 4: Databases and SQL</h3>
  <p>
    I learned to use SQL to query and manipulate data in relational databases. I used joins and filters to identify patterns and support investigations.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL’s use in cybersecurity</li>
    <li>Relational database structure</li>
    <li>Filtering data with SQL queries</li>
    <li>Joining tables for combined insights</li>
  </ul>
