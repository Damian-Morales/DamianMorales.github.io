  <h1>Course 5: Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities – Summary</h1>

  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In Course 5, I learned how to identify and protect organizational assets, uncover vulnerabilities, and understand threats to digital assets. Through four modules, I explored the NIST framework, asset security principles, vulnerability management, and threat modeling techniques.
  </p>

  <h3>Module 1: Introduction to Asset Security</h3>
  <p>
    I discovered how organizations decide what they need to protect and why classifying assets by value is critical. I learned the definitions of threat, vulnerability, asset, and risk, and saw how the NIST Cybersecurity Framework guides asset security decisions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define threat, vulnerability, asset, and risk</li>
    <li>Explain security’s role in mitigating organizational risk</li>
    <li>Classify assets based on value</li>
    <li>Identify data states: in use, in transit, and at rest</li>
    <li>Discuss the benefits of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 2: Protect Organizational Assets</h3>
  <p>
    I focused on security controls that safeguard both physical and digital assets. I gained hands-on understanding of encryption and hashing for data privacy, and explored how authentication and authorization verify and enforce user access.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify effective data handling processes</li>
    <li>Identify how security controls mitigate risk</li>
    <li>Discuss the role of encryption and hashing</li>
    <li>Describe effective authentication practices</li>
    <li>Describe effective authorization practices</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 3: Vulnerabilities in Systems</h3>
  <p>
    I built a clear view of the vulnerability management lifecycle and learned common software and hardware vulnerabilities. By adopting an attacker mindset, I saw how exposures become real threats when exploited, and how to assess an attack surface.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Differentiate between vulnerabilities and threats</li>
    <li>Describe defense-in-depth strategy</li>
    <li>Explain how CVE and MITRE identify exposures</li>
    <li>Explain how vulnerability assessments assess potential risk</li>
    <li>Analyze an attack surface</li>
    <li>Develop an attacker mindset to recognize threats</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Module 4: Threats to Asset Security</h3>
  <p>
    I examined common threat types—social engineering, malware, and web-based exploits—and the tools attackers use. This module introduced me to structured threat modeling, which prepares security teams to stay ahead of breaches.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify forms of social engineering</li>
    <li>Identify different types of malware</li>
    <li>Identify forms of web-based exploits</li>
    <li>Summarize the threat modeling process</li>
  </ul>
